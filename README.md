# ksat

KSAT is a simple asynchronous job scheduling solution for python applications.
It allows to delegate long running functions to be done as tasks by another cluster.


# Development

You will need to install `pip install dev-requirements.txt`
We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), and you can run all tests by simply calling:
```
$ pytest
```
